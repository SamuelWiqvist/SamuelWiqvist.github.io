title: "About me"
---

I have a background in engineering and complied my Master of Engineering degree from Lund University in 2016. After that I joined the PhD program in mathematical statistics at Lund University, and I am currently pursuing said PhD degree under the supervision of Umberto Picchini. 

My technical interest are: Bayesian statistics, simulation based inference, and methods for combining machine learning and classical inference methods.

On my free time I like to do power lifting inspired strength training.
