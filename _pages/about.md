title: "About me"
---

I have a background in engineering, and I completed my Master of Engineering degree from Lund University in 2016. After that, I joined the Ph.D. program in mathematical statistics at Lund University, and I am currently pursuing said Ph.D. degree under the supervision of Umberto Picchini.

My technical interest are: Bayesian statistics, simulation-based inference, and methods for combining machine learning and classical inference methods.

In my free time, I like to do powerlifting inspired strength training.
