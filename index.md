Welcome to my site! I am a Bayesian statistician/data scientist currently pursuing a PhD in Mathematical statistics at Lund University. My technical interest are: Bayesian statistics, simulation based inference, and methods for combining machine learning and classical inference methods.

NB: This site is still under construction.
