Welcome to my site! I have a Ph.D. in mathematical statistics at Lund University, Sweden, and I now work as a data scientist at Danske Bank in the Fraud Machine Learning, Data & Analytics team.

## About me

I have a background in engineering, and I completed my Master of Engineering degree from Lund University, Sweden in 2016. After that, I joined the Ph.D. program in mathematical statistics at Lund University, Sweden where I worked under the supervision of Dr. [Umberto Picchini](https://umbertopicchini.github.io/). I completed said Ph.D. degree in fall of 2021 (for more information on my Ph.D. reseach work, see the [research page](https://samuelwiqvist.github.io/research/)). 

I now work as a data scientist at Danske Bank in the Fraud Machine Learning, Data & Analytics team.

My technical interests are: Bayesian statistics, simulation-based inference, and generative models. I am also,  in addition to that, interested in replicable research and research software engineering practices.
