Welcome to my site! I am a Bayesian statistician/data scientist currently pursuing a Ph.D. in mathematical statistics at Lund University, Sweden. My technical interests are: Bayesian statistics, simulation-based inference, and methods for combining machine learning and classical inference methods. I am also,  in addition to that, interested in replicable research and research software engineering practices.
