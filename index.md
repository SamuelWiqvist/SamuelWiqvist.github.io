Welcome to my site! I am a Bayesian statistician/data scientist currently pursuing a Ph.D. in mathematical statistics at Lund University, Sweden.

## About me

I have a background in engineering, and I completed my Master of Engineering degree from Lund University, Sweden in 2016. After that, I joined the Ph.D. program in mathematical statistics at Lund University, Sweden, and I am currently pursuing said Ph.D. degree under the supervision of [Umberto Picchini](https://umbertopicchini.github.io/).

My technical interests are: Bayesian statistics, simulation-based inference, and methods for combining machine learning and classical inference methods. I am also,  in addition to that, interested in replicable research and research software engineering practices.
You can find more information on my research on the [research page](https://samuelwiqvist.github.io/research/).


In my free time, I like to do powerlifting inspired strength training.
